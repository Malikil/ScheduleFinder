Average Schedule Finder
===
This is a little idea I've had floating around in my head for a while, a small program for finding what times of day something is expected to be on or off.  
Used when you can check the current state of the item basically whenever, but aren't able to watch 24/7 for the exact moment it turns on or off.

I also take general trends over the course of a day, a week, and a month. With the thinking that the activation times might not be exactly the same every day, or could happen more than once per day.

The method I ended up going with also resembles another idea I've had for a while for finding an average path or route. Where the accuracy of the route could be improved as more readings are taken, even if the measured points along the route aren't necessarily close to the ones already there.
